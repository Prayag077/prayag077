# Welcome Folks! 👨‍💻

Hi, I’m **Prayag**, a **self-learning coder** who developed a strong interest in programming the moment I got my first laptop.  
My curiosity about *how things work behind the scenes* pushed me to explore coding, build projects, and continuously improve my problem-solving skills.

I enjoy learning by building real projects and aim to grow into a professional software developer.
